# CauseEffect

A begginer project from [florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17/)'s list made using Flutter. The simple goal in this project is to display a list of names, and as the user taps on any of the names, the app retrieves data such as city, state, country and other personal info for each person on the list, then show the retrieved data dynamically on an adjacent page.
